# Hand-Gesture-game
This is a Space-Invader-themed game that can be played using hand gestures. 
I thought it would be interesting to allow the user to control the game using hand gestures rather than a mouse and keyboard. 
The module used for hand-detection is MediaPipe, with OpenCV controlling the camera. 
The controls are based on the detection of landmarks on the user's hand.
